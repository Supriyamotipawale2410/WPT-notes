HTML 
	🡺 hypertext markup language
     	🡺 data presentation and UI designing  (sign up, login, registration, 	search form…)
     	🡺We can design static web pages
             	
CSS 
	🡺 Cascading Style Sheets
	🡺 Used to change look & feel of webpage (html elements)
     	🡺It helps to present data more effectively, attractively & 	animations
 
JavaScript 
	🡺it provides logical support to html pages
     	🡺 its works like as back-end for html/css
     	🡺used to develop interactive web pages

BootStrap   
	=> Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. 

Html, css, JavaScript & BootStrap are web technologies, these techs are used to develop web applications.


=> Web app is collection of webpages
=> Web page is group of html elements
Element means textbox, button, image, audio, video, para, heading, table, checkbox, radio,etc.


 Server
	=> A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other machines, known as clients, over a network/inet.
In theory, whenever computers share resources with client machines, they are considered servers
	=> A server stores all the data associated with the websites that are hosted by it and shares that info with all computers and mobile devices (like yours) that need to access them.
Server provides data services to clients

Client

	=> A client is a device that connects to and uses the resources of a remote computer, or server.
Clients may use a desktop or a laptop or a tablet or a mobile phone or a TV or a car etc.
The device which is used by the user is called a “Client”.
Client is a media between server & end-user
 
End-User
	=>The person who is working on/operating a client machine is known as User or end-user

WHAT IS APPLICATION OR SOFTWARE?
	=> Application is an Automation process of manual business operations (human being work) by using a programming language.
 
WHAT IS WEB APPLICATION?
	=> Web applications are network enabled applications. We can deploy any web applications in servers and we can access them over the network using server ip address and application name.
In computing, a web application is a client–server software application which the client (or user interface) runs in a web browser and it contains web documents in the form of electronic pages (web pages).
 	=>A web application typically contains following three layers:      	
*  Presentation layer is a user interface (views) which are accessible from any web browser.
 
*  Business layer is a server-side program which is nothing but automation of business rules. Client layer will interact with the business layer to persist data.
 
*  Data layer is database software where we can store client related data. Business layer will interact with the data layer.

Internet
	=>The Internet stands for international networking.
	=>The Internet is a network of connected computers. No company owns the Internet; it is a cooperative effort governed by a system of standards and rules. The purpose of connecting computers together, of course, is to share information.

			HTML introduction

1.    	HTML was developed by “Tim-Berners-Lee”, released in 1993-dec/94 and maintained by W3C Org.        	
	 GML  ⇒   	SGML  ⇒ HTML 	
                  	  90               91           	94
 
  2.   	HTML stands for “Hypertext Markup Language”.
“Hypertext” means the text that can be transferred from internet server to internet client.
"Markup" means which syntax will be in the form of tags or you simply "markup" a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display.
“Language” is an interface between web developer and web browser
 
3.    	Technically, HTML is not a programming language, but rather a markup language.  
 
4.    	HTML is used to design "static web pages", static web pages that always show the same information.
 
5.  	HTML is very easy to understand (no prerequisites).
 
6.  	HTML is “client side tech”. That means the html code executes on the client browser but not on the server.
 
7.  	HTML is supported by all the browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Safari, Opera and other browsers.            	      	
      	
8.  	HTML is used in all real time web sites today; html is the only language available in the world for designing Web pages.
  
9. For working html no need installs any software, and browser is responsible for executing & producing output of html programs.
               	Typing & saving ⇒ notepad
               	Execution & result ⇒ Browser
 
		Notepad++, editplus, VS Code, Sublime, Ec, netbeans
 
10. Html is error free programming.
      	(while working with url/address only we will get errors)
 
11. HTML is not a case sensitive language that means you can write the html code in either uppercase or lower case.

12. HTML is an interpreter-based language. Browser interprets HTML code.
Translators: converting high level code (human) into machine level code (MP/OS) is called translation.
Who performs this operation are called translators.
Types:    	compiler, interpreter, assembler
interpreter  it translates code line-by-line and executes line-by-line (interpretation)
                          	     interpreter
	html code  ⇐=============⇒ machine code
	(English)                                         (Binary code)




Tag:               	
·      A tag is a keyword, enclosed within "<" and ">" in HTML language.
·      It is a special kind of text placed between the left angular brace and right angular brace(<tag_name>).
·      Tag is a predefined program, program is instructions / command to the browser.
·      Tag is used to display some specific output in the web page.
·      Browser did not identify the tag; it shows a blank page or it prints as text.
·      tags also represented as elements.
 
types of tags
in html we have two types tags, those are:
1.	paired tags
⇒ Contains open tag and closing tag.       	
⇒ Opening tag specifies starting point of operation/output, closing tag specifies ending point of operation/output. 
Syn:   <tagname> text </tagname>         	
            ex:  	<html>  ...  </html>
        	        <head> ... </head>
        	        <body> … </body>
        	        <script> ...  </script>
			<style> ... </style>
     	          <p> …  </p>       	
  note: paired tags also called as body-full tags
 
2. unpaired tags
⇒ contains only open tag.
      	Syn:   <tagname>     	or  	<tagname/>
      	ex:   <br/>  	<img/>   <input/> 	<hr>	<link>    <meta>
⇒ Unpaired tags also called as body-less tags
⇒self closed tags


Structure of HTML
As per W3C we have to follow the following structure to design web pages (but it’s not comp).
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=”en”>  
<head>
</head>     	
<body>
</body>  	                    	
</html>      
 
 Generally, html program contains three parts, those are:
    	 > Versioning section                    	
    	 > Head section
    	 > Body section


Versioning section   ==          	
This is providing information to the browser which version we are using in the web page/program. So, browser is interpreting code and producing output as per given specification.

Syn:    	  <!DOCTYPE  html  version-url>
HTML4.0:
<!DOCTYPE html public "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.0//EN" "http://www.w3c.org/TR/html3/strict.dtd">

    	<!DOCTYPE html>  ⇐ use’s new version of html
strcit.dtd file (document type definition) contains definitions of tags and specifications.

head tag ==
=> head tag represents a non-content section (means not output) of the web page.
This information doesn't appear on the web page/in the browser (it's called as non-content), but it's used internally by the browser.
=> This tag is used to set icons, title, to provide some meta data (info about web app), css settings, java scripting etc...

=> head tag contains some child/sub tags, those are             	
    	<link>,  <title>, <meta>,   <style>, <script> and <base> tags
 

body tag ==

=> body tag represents content information (means output) of the web page.
this information appears on the web page/in the browser (it’s called content).
=> This tag is used to design UI or to display output.
body tag contains so many child/sub tags.

=> some of tags: p, img, h1, table, div, a, table, audio, video, input, button, form, ol, ul, li, hr tags …

⇒ save that program with any name (.html or .htm) and anywhere in the system.
⇒ execution:         	
  	1st Approach: goto file location, then double click on file
  	2nd Approach: goto file location, then right click on file and click on open then select browser
  	3rd Approach: open any browser, then goto address bar and type filename with address.
for ex: ---  e:/test.html
