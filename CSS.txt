				CSS	





	Cascading Style Sheets 3
	Released in 1996 & maintained by W3C Org
	Used to change look/feel of html elements (makeover)
Like color, background, border, alignment, wallpaper, animations, size of element, padding, margin, opacity etc…
	CSS provides only styles but not tags
	Style is group of properties or is a rule

			
Where we can define styles?
We can define styles in 3 places, those are:
	Inline styles
	Internal styles
	External styles


Different ways to implement css:
Inline (1stApproch)
Html tag and css properties both are defined within the same line
Syn:-<tag   style=”property:value; property:value; … “>
		  
		 

	Unique style or personal style
			

Internal (2ndApproch):
	Html tags and css styles are designed in the same program, but not in same line.
	Internal css should be implements in Style tag, style tag must be sub tag “head” tag.

Syn:-
	   <style>
	       tag {				
		property:value;
		property:value;
		…….
      }		
	       Tag {
		property:value;
		property:value;
		…….
      }
     Etc…
	  </style>
 



External (3rdApproch)
Css styles are defined in separate file and should be save with “.css”, and html code designed in separate file, should be save with saved with “.html” 	
Use link tag for mapping css file to html file
Syn: 		<link  rel=”stylesheet”  href=”filename.css”/>


note:
	css attributes we can't use in place of html attributes.
	html attributes we can't in place of css attributes.

html colors
html supports 3types of patterns, those are
> named colors
> RGB colors
> Hexadecimal colors

named colors:
>it supports to write direct color name
>we have some limited colors
	ex: white, black, red, green etc...
> Color names are not case-sen
RGB colors:
>RGB model specifies that the composition of 3 basic colors (Red, Green, Blue)
>RGB produces 16millions colors.
			
   Syn:  rgb(red,green,blue)	
	red => 0 - 255		
	green => 0 - 255
	blue => 0 – 255
	ex: rgb(10, 45, 201)	401%255  146

Hexadecimal number colors:
>Hexadecimal model is the shortcut for rgb model
>Hexadecimal system ranges from 0 - 15
		0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e,f
Syn:	#RRGGBB		1,2 red	3,4 green	5,6 blue
		ex: #1a4b68	
	#RGB
		ex:	#3d7
Note: in realtime "Hexadecimal model" is recommended.

these colors we can use for foreground color, background color, border color
etc..
for setting colors we have some attributes, those are
color		 to set/to change foreground color (text color)
background-color   to set/to change background color
border-color	 to set/to change border color (line color)
box-shadow	 to set/to change shadow color 
text-shadow	 to set/to change text shadow color
Note: all these are CSS attributes. Support by Most of html tags


Gradient colors
background: #FC466B; 

background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #3F5EFB, #FC466B);   

linear-gradient(direction, color1,color2,…color-n)
		dir: to left (r=>l)
		       to right (l=>r)
		       to top (b=>t)
		       to bottom (t=>b)

background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #3F5EFB 40%, #FC466B 60%);

 -webkit-linear-gradient(to left, #3F5EFB, #FC466B);  
linear-gradient(to left, #3F5EFB, #FC466B); 

background: radial-gradient(circle, rgba(2,0,36,1) 0%, rgba(38,38,162,1) 60%, rgba(0,212,255,1) 100%);

radial-gradient(shape, color1, color2, …color-n)

radial-gradient(circle, rgb(131,58,180) 0%, rgb(29,166,65) 50%, rgb(252,176,69) 100%);

radial-gradient(circle, rgba(166,29,142,1) 57%, rgba(100,180,111,1) 78%, rgba(69,252,96,1) 100%);
Note: while applying gradient colors we have to use “background” property in place of “background-color”.

CSS Float
The CSS float property is a positioning property. It is used to push an element to the left or right, allowing other element to wrap around it. It is generally used with images and layouts.
How it works
Elements are floated only horizontally. So it is possible only to float elements left or right, not up or down.
●	A floated element may be moved as far to the left or the right as possible. Simply, it means that a floated element can display at extreme left or extreme right.
●	The elements after the floating element will flow around it.
●	The elements before the floating element will not be affected.
●	If the image floated to the right, the texts flow around it, to the left and if the image floated to the left, the text flows around it, to the right.

CSS Float Properties
clear(property)---The clear property is used to avoid elements after the floating elements which flow around it.--values---left, right, both, none, inherit
float(property)---It specifies whether the box should float or not.--values---left, right, none, inherit

CSS Font

CSS font is used for design text or font for display on web page. CSS font properties define the font family, boldness, size, and the style of a text.
Font-style property:
Font styles are used for set font style. Font style property has three values they are;
●	normal: The text is shown normally
●	italic: The text is shown in italics
●	oblique: The text is "leaning" (oblique is very similar to italic, but less supported)


Font-Size property:
We can define size of font in following way
With Em
With Percent
With Pixels
If you set the text size with pixels then you can gives full control over the text size.


Font size in Em
The em size unit is recommended by the W3C. 1em is equal to default text size in browsers (16px). 
The size convert pixels to em using this formula: pixels/16=em

font-size: 2.5em; /* 40px/16=2.5em */

Font size in percent
Text size work on all browsers, you can use default font-size in percent for the <body> element.




CSS Margin

●	top
●	bottom
●	left
●	right
 

CSS Overflow
CSS overflow property used to handle the content when it overflows its block level container.
Why the need for Overflow?
Suppose if you do not set the height and width of any box then it goes larger as content, but if you do not set height or width of box but content cannot fit inside the box then it goes overflow. The CSS overflow property is used to overcome this problem.
Overflow property values

visible	---It specifies that overflow is not clipped. It renders outside the element's box. This is a default value.
hidden	---It specifies that the overflow is clipped, and rest of the content will be invisible.
scroll	---It specifies that the overflow is clipped, and a scroll bar is used to see the rest of the content.
auto	---It specifies that if overflow is clipped, a scroll bar is needed to see the rest of the content.
Example: 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
div.scroll {  
background-color: cyan;  
width: 200px;  
height: 150px;  
overflow: scroll;  
}  
div.hidden {  
background-color: pink;  
width: 100px;  
height: 150px;  
overflow: hidden;  
}  
div.auto {  
background-color: yellow;  
width: 100px;  
height: 150px;  
overflow: auto;  
}  
</style>
</head>
<body>
<p>overflow:scroll</p>
<div class="scroll">
If contents go out of the container then a scroll bar is used to see the rest of the content.
</div>
<p>overflow:hidden</p>
<div class="hidden">
It specifies that the overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible.
</div>
<p>overflow:auto</p>
<div class="auto">
It specifies that if overflow is clipped, a scroll bar is needed to see the rest of the content.
</div>
</body>
</html>
